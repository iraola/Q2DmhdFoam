Based on Smolentsev, "Effect of a magnetic field on stability and transitions in liquid breeder flows in a blanket" (2013).

- Long channel (2 m width by 60 m high), DNS, upwards flow
- 4 cases generating different turbulence strengths
    * Strong turbulence
        * (a) Ha = 50, Gr = 10e8, Re = 5000; 
        * (b) Ha = 75, Gr = 10e8, Re = 7500. 
    * Weak turbulence: 
        * (c) Ha = 75, Gr = 5 Ã— 10e7, Re = 10,000; 
        * (d) Ha = 120, Gr = 10e8, Re = 5000
- He uses a periodic boundary condition
