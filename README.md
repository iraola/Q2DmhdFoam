# Q2DmhdFoam

`Q2DmhdFoam` is a custom OpenFOAM solver based on the built-in boussinesqBuoyantFoam solver that solves magnetohydrodynamic flows with buoyancy effects. To this end, the simplification of Sommeria and Moreau [1] is used. This allows us to run magnetohydrodynamic cases much faster than with the rigorous three-dimensional approach, thus being useful to get preliminary results before spending large amounts of time computing complex cases. The C++ solver can be found in the [`Q2DmhdFoam`](https://github.com/iraola/Q2DmhdFoam/tree/main/Q2DmhdFoam) directory.

The repository also includes some [`tutorials`](https://github.com/iraola/Q2DmhdFoam/tree/main/tutorials), [`validation`](https://github.com/iraola/Q2DmhdFoam/tree/main/validation) cases, and [`Python`](https://github.com/iraola/Q2DmhdFoam/tree/main/python) scripts to automate runs and OpenFOAM data postprocessing.

`Q2DmhdFoam` was developed as a project for Hakan Nilsson's PhD course for CFD with OpenSource Software [2]. For the full report and further information, access Chalmers University of Technology webpage [here](http://www.tfd.chalmers.se/~hani/kurser/OS_CFD/#YEAR_2020).
